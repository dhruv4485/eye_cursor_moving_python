Building a robust and accurate eye cursor movement system requires advanced computer vision techniques, machine learning, and potentially specialized hardware. The following outlines a more sophisticated approach compared to the basic example provided earlier.

Key Components
Eye Tracking:

Hardware: Utilize specialized eye-tracking hardware or high-quality webcams with precise calibration.
Software: Employ libraries like OpenCV, dlib, or MediaPipe for image processing and facial landmark detection.
Algorithms: Implement advanced eye tracking algorithms, such as pupil detection, gaze estimation, and calibration techniques.
Consider: Incorporate machine learning models for improved accuracy and robustness.
Cursor Control:

Libraries: Use pyautogui or platform-specific libraries (e.g., pywin32 for Windows) to control the mouse cursor.
Mapping: Establish a mapping between eye movements and cursor movements, considering factors like screen resolution, eye movement range, and desired sensitivity.
Smoothing: Implement smoothing algorithms to filter out noise and provide a smoother cursor movement experience.
Calibration:

Procedure: Develop a calibration process to map eye positions to screen coordinates for each user.
Accuracy: Ensure accurate calibration for precise cursor control.
